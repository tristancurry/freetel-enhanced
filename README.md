## A Teltron Beam Deflection Tube Simulator


The Teltron apparatus includes a set of electron beam tubes that are used to demonstrate, amongst other things,
- the interaction of charged particles with electric and magnetic fields
- a procedure for determining the charge:mass ratio of the electron
- diffraction of electrons

This is a simulation of the electron beam deflection tube. The electron beam passes into a region containing an nearly uniform magnetic field and and a nearly uniform electric field that are mutually perpendicular with the beam direction. The strength of each field, and the speed of the electrons can be adjusted, usually in such a way that the beam is not deflected. The equilibrium of forces (due to the different fields) is used to find the charge to mass ratio of the electron.

This enhanced version of Freetel has been ported to the browser from the original old-timey version written in Processing.
The original can be found at [the Freetel repository page](https://github.com/tristancurry/Freetel). (At the time of writing this Read Me, this version is not functioning due to changes in the ControlP5 library it relies on).
